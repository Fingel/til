When it comes to numbers, English is pretty confusing. The spoken words for 1-10 are One, two, three,
four, five, six, seven, ten. Easy enough. But after that things get weird. What is eleven (and why does it
take so long to say?) Twelve and thirteen sort of sound like "two" and "three", but only if you
don't think about it too hard. Then comes twenty, which switches everything around from the teens. Instead
of the single digit coming before the TEEN (like fourTEEN) it switches to after, like twentyFOUR. It
is no wonder why English is so difficult to learn.


By contrast, here are the spoken words for 1-10 in Mandarin Chinese: yi, èr, sān, sì, wǔ, liù, qī,
bā, jiǔ, shí. The first thing to notice is these words are incredibly
short and fast to speak. This makes sense with how the rest of the numbers are constructed. How
to say eleven? Shí yī (10 + 1). Twelve is Shí èr ( 10 + 2), and so on up until Twenty,
which is Èr shí (2 * 10). This really makes sense doesn't it? Twenty-four? Èr shí sì ( 2 * 10 + 4).
Every number can be constructed by the 9 spoken words.

What's really interesting about this is that the formula for creating the numbers themselves is
implanted directly into the spoken word. Forty-two is Sì shí èr in Chinese, which translates
to "Four tens and 2". Now imagine doing arithmetic in your head if this is the way you think
about numbers. 42 + 15 becomes (Four tens and two) + (One ten and five) = Five tens and seven = 57.
The English speaker must first translate the spoken words into numbers, then add them up. This step
is much easier for the Chinese speaker.

Another interesting thing about numbers in Chinese is the ability to count to 10 on one hand:

When it comes to Chinese (and other Asian language) speakers math proficiency
there are [studies](http://www.oecd.org/newsroom/Asian-countries-top-OECD-s-latest-PISA-survey-on-state-of-global-education.htm), there are
[ideas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_relativity) and there are
stereotypes. No need to go down that road, I can't say anything here that hasn't already been said.
But what I can say is, when it comes to number language, English vs Chinese feels like
imperial vs. metric units. One is arbitrary and difficult and the other is logical and easy.
