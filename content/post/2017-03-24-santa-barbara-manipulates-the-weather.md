{{% nt %}}You're at the bar Friday after work.{{% /nt %}} You've gotten to that ugly point
during the smalltalk where you ask someone what they do:

"I make it rain."

No, not $100 bills. Water, unfortunately.

This person probably works for the
[Santa Barbara County Water Agency](http://cosb.countyofsb.org/pwd/pwwater.aspx?id=2956),
which, according to their website:

>   The Santa Barbara County Water Agency conducts a weather modification program better known
    as "cloudseeding" to augment rainfall and runoff in watersheds behind the major water
    reservoirs.

Cloud seeding is the act of "seeding" clouds with agents that augment condensation. This is
to say, putting stuff (usually Silver Iodine) in clouds that makes water stick together.
This is done by either flying planes near clouds and lighting flares,
or launching mortars into the sky from the ground.
The idea is that by doing this you can squeeze out a little bit of extra rain you wouldn't normally get.

Santa Barbara has been performing rain seeding since 1981 in an attempt to augment rainfall in the
Santa Ynez and Twitchell watersheds. They [cite reaserch](http://cosb.countyofsb.org/uploadedFiles/pwd/Water/WaterAgency/13NGD-00011_FINAL_.pdf)
mostly from the late 70's/early 80's that show cloud seeding as an effective means of weather modification.

This research is fairly hard to back up and is somewhat controversial. Proving in a lab setting that Silver Iodine
is an effective "freezing nuclei" is not difficult. But how do you prove it in the field? You can't know
how much if would have rained without seeding, and no two storms are exactly the same, so you can't compare
them either.

The lack of hard evidence doesn't stop companies like
[Weather Modification Inc](http://www.weathermodification.com) from working with municipalities all
around the North America. WMI's list of services includes rain augmentation, hail reduction and fog
clearing. They do not appear to be low on clients.

It's not hard to see why Santa Barbara would attempt weather modification. The region is just now
recovering from a record breaking drought.

According to an [interview on Scientific American with Arlen Huggins of the Desert Research Institute](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/cloud-seeding-china-snow/)
The best time to attempt weather modification is when there is already normal or above normal levels
of precipitation (we can't create storms out of nothing, yet). That would be Santa Barbara, right now (2017).

Cloud seeding is not as effective as say, [desalination](http://www.santabarbaraca.gov/gov/depts/pw/resources/system/sources/desalination.asp) (which Santa Barbara is actively pursuing) at producing water.
It also doesn't work if there is no precipitation at all, like during the periods of severe drought
the region has been experiencing. However, cloud seeding is cheap compared to the alternatives. Even
if the research is a little shaky, the (often cited) 20% increase of rainfall makes the attempt well
worth it.

Keep making it rain, Santa Barbara.
