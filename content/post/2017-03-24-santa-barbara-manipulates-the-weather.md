{{% nt %}}You're at the bar Friday after work.{{% /nt %}} You've gotten to that ugly point
during the smalltalk where you ask someone what they do:

"I make it rain."

After a brief moment of hope where you imagine showers of $100 bills, you lean this person
means it literally. You probably think they're full of shit, right?

If this person happens to work for the
[Santa Barbara County Water Agency](http://cosb.countyofsb.org/pwd/pwwater.aspx?id=2956),
maybe not. According to their website:

>   The Santa Barbara County Water Agency conducts a weather modification program better known
    as "cloudseeding" to augment rainfall and runoff in watersheds behind the major water
    reservoirs.

Cloud seeding is the act of "seeding" clouds with agents that augment condensation. This is
to say, putting stuff (usually Silver Iodine) in clouds that makes water stick together.
This is done by either flying planes near clouds and shooting rockets at them,
or launching mortars into the sky from the ground.
The idea is that by doing this you can squeeze out a little bit of extra rain you wouldn't normally get.

If this sounds far fetched, it's really not. There are [companies](http://www.weathermodification.com)
that specialize in providing equipment and services for performing weather modification
to municipalities around the world.

Santa Barbara is one of those municipalities.

## Santa Barbara's Epic Drought

Compared to last year, California as a whole is in a much better place
than it was 12 months ago. Still, there are some orange (drought) areas on
the map. Santa Barbara is right in the middle of them. Although the region has
received higher than normal average rainfall, there is still a ways to go before
breaking even with the last 5 years:

<table class="pure-table">
    <caption>Santa Barbara Yearly Rainfall</caption>
    <thead><tr><td>Year</td><td>2012</td><td>2013</td><td>2014</td><td>2015</td><td>2016</td><td>2017</td></tr></thead>
    <tbody><tr><td>% Normal Rainfall</td><td>66</td><td>46</td><td>41</td><td>55</td><td>70</td><td>130</td></tr></tbody>
</table>



Apparently the best time to do cloud seeding is when you have normal levels, or higher-than-normal levels, of precipitation. [1](#1)
